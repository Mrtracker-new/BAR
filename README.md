## üìù Best Practices

- **Password Security**: Use strong, unique passwords with a mix of character types
- **Security Parameters**: Set appropriate security constraints based on data sensitivity
- **Backup Strategy**: Regularly back up non-sensitive data (remember that securely deleted files CANNOT be recovered)
- **Deadman Switch**: Be cautious with this feature - files will be permanently deleted if not accessed within the specified period
- **Device Scanning**: Scan removable devices before importing files to ensure integrity
- **Logging**: Check the logs in `~/.bar/logs` directory for troubleshooting
- **Hardware Binding**: Enable for critical files to prevent unauthorized access from different devices
- **Security Levels**: Choose appropriate security level based on threat model:
  - *Standard*: 5 failed attempts ‚Üí temporary lockout
  - *High*: 4 failed attempts ‚Üí progressive lockouts (up to 24 hours)
  - *Maximum*: 3 failed attempts ‚Üí **PERMANENT DATA DESTRUCTION**
- **Panic Wipe**: Emergency destruction available through UI or hotkeys
- **Password Recovery**: **CRITICAL** - No password recovery exists. Forgotten password = complete data loss
- **Complete Reset**: Panic wipe removes ALL traces, application starts fresh after system restart
