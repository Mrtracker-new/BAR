## ⚠️ Please Read This First!

I need to be super clear about what BAR does and the risks involved. This isn't just legal mumbo-jumbo - it's important stuff that could save you from losing data or getting in trouble.

---

## 🚨 The Big Warnings

### Data Loss is PERMANENT

When BAR deletes something, it's **GONE FOREVER**. Seriously:

- ❌ **No "undo" button**
- ❌ **No recovery software will work**
- ❌ **No password recovery**
- ❌ **If you forget your password, your data is lost**
- ❌ **Self-destruct features trigger automatically**

I use DoD-compliant multi-pass overwrite. That means even the NSA couldn't recover your files (probably).

### No Guarantees

BAR comes "as is." If something goes wrong:

- I'm not responsible for lost data
- I'm not responsible for any damages
- I'm not liable for security breaches
- You use this software at your own risk

This is free, open-source software. There's no warranty, customer support team, or money-back guarantee.

## 📜 Legal Stuff You Need to Know

### Encryption Laws

Some countries restrict encryption software. **It's YOUR job** to:

- ✅ Check if using encryption is legal where you live
- ✅ Understand your local laws about data protection
- ✅ Make sure you're complying with regulations

I built BAR for legitimate use. Don't use it:

- ❌ To hide illegal activity
- ❌ To obstruct legal investigations  
- ❌ To delete legally required records
- ❌ For anything sketchy or illegal

### Data Protection Rules

If you handle data covered by GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, or similar:

- Check that using BAR complies with your requirements
- Don't use it to delete stuff you're legally required to keep
- Understand your data retention obligations
- Keep proper records if needed for compliance

## 🔐 Security Warnings

### Password Security

**Your password is EVERYTHING:**

- Use a strong, unique password (12+ characters, mix of types)
- Never share your password with anyone
- NO PASSWORD RECOVERY exists - forget it and data is lost
- Hardware binding means it only works on your device

**Security Levels:**

- **Standard**: 5 wrong attempts = lockout
- **High**: 4 wrong attempts = longer lockouts
- **Maximum**: 3 wrong attempts = EVERYTHING DELETES

Choose wisely!

### Screenshot Protection Limitations

My screenshot protection is pretty good, but it's not perfect:

**Can Block:**
- ✅ Print Screen key
- ✅ Windows Snipping Tool (Win+Shift+S)
- ✅ Clipboard screenshots
- ✅ Many screenshot apps

**Can't Block:**
- ❌ Phone cameras (hardware limitation)
- ❌ External capture devices
- ❌ Some admin-level tools
- ❌ Remote desktop captures

Don't rely on it as your only protection!

### Hardware Binding

If you enable hardware binding:

- Files only work on the device where you encrypted them
- Hardware changes (new motherboard, etc.) = permanent data loss
- Device failure = permanent data loss
- No way to transfer to another computer

## 💻 System Requirements & Risks

### Windows-Specific

BAR works best on Windows 10/11:

- Some features need admin rights
- Keyboard hooks might conflict with antivirus
- Uses system-level API calls
- May impact system performance

### What Can Go Wrong

Honest list of things that might happen:

- Self-destruct triggers when you don't expect it
- Screenshot protection closes other apps
