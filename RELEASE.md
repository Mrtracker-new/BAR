### üöÄ Release Highlights

We're excited to announce the enhanced release of BAR (Burn After Reading) - a standalone desktop application featuring revolutionary screenshot protection, streamlined authentication, and military-grade security for sensitive file management.

### What is BAR?

BAR is a completely offline file management system designed for users who need the highest level of security and privacy. It allows you to store sensitive files with customizable security parameters including time-based expiration, access count limits, and deadman switch functionality.

### ‚ú® Key Features

**üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Security Architecture**
- **100% Offline Security**: Works without internet connection or server dependencies
- **Military-Grade Encryption**: AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption protects all content
- **Device-Bound Authentication**: Single-user device authentication with hardware binding
- **Advanced Screenshot Protection**: Revolutionary multi-layer anti-capture system

**üî• Self-Destruction Mechanisms**
- **Time-based Expiration**: Files delete after specified time periods
- **Access Count Limits**: Files delete after being viewed a set number of times
- **Deadman Switch**: Files delete after periods of inactivity
- **Anti-Brute Force**: Files delete after multiple failed password attempts
- **DoD-Compliant Deletion**: Multi-pass overwrite for unrecoverable destruction

**üì∏ Revolutionary Screenshot Protection**
- **Real-time Keyboard Blocking**: Intercepts Print Screen, Win+Shift+S, Alt+Print Screen

2. No installation required - simply double-click to run

#### Option 2: Building from Source
1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
2. Clone the repository
3. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the build script: python build.py
5. Find the executable in the dist directory

### üöÄ First-Time Setup (v2.0.0+)

**Device Initialization:**
1. **Launch Application**: Run BAR.exe (no installation required)
2. **Initialize Device**: Click "Initialize Device" on first startup
3. **Set Master Password**: Create strong master password for device unlock
4. **Hardware Binding**: Password automatically bound to current device
5. **Start Securing**: Begin adding files with custom security settings

**Simplified Authentication:**
- **No User Accounts**: Single device authentication replaces user system
- **One Password**: Master password unlocks all secure storage
- **Session Persistence**: Stays unlocked during application session
- **Device Portability**: Files remain locked to initialization device

### üîí Security Notice

**Critical Security Information:**
- **Unrecoverable Deletion**: Files that self-destruct CANNOT be recovered by any means
- **No Password Recovery**: Master password cannot be recovered - choose wisely
- **Hardware Binding**: Password only works on device where it was created
- **Complete Privacy**: All operations local - no data transmitted externally

**Screenshot Protection Limitations:**
- **Mobile Cameras**: Cannot block physical phone/camera screenshots
- **External Capture**: Hardware capture devices may bypass protection
- **Administrator Tools**: Some elevated screenshot tools may bypass protection
