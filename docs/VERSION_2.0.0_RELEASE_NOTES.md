## 🎉 Big Update - Version 2.0!

This is a **major release** that makes BAR simpler, faster, and more secure. I've streamlined everything to focus on what matters - keeping your data safe!

## 🚀 What's New & Improved

### Simpler Authentication

**Before**: Device Setup → Device Unlock → Login Screen → Main App  
**Now**: Device Setup → Device Unlock → Main App ✅

You only authenticate once per session now! No more confusing double-login.

### One Device, One User

BAR is now truly personal:
- **Your device, your app** - No multi-user accounts
- **Hardware-bound** - Security tied to your specific computer
- **Simpler** - Less complexity = better security
- **Faster** - Skip the extra login step

---

## ✨ New Features

### Single-User Security
- Master password locks to your device
- Hardware fingerprinting keeps it secure
- No password recovery (by design)
- Emergency wipe if needed

### Enhanced File Viewing
- Smarter file type detection
- Better viewing for images, text, and media
- Watermarks for view-only files
- More file formats supported

### Framework Update (PySide6)
- Fixed Windows compatibility issues

## 🗑️ What I Removed

I cleaned up a lot of old stuff:

- ❌ Multi-user account system

**Result**: Simpler, faster, more secure!
