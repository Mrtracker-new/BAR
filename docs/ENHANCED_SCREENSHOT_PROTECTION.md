## 🛡️ Overview

The Enhanced Screenshot Protection System represents a revolutionary advancement in software-based anti-capture technology. This comprehensive system provides multi-layer defense against screenshot attempts, screen recording, and unauthorized visual capture of sensitive content within the BAR application.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Traditional screenshot protection methods in desktop applications often rely on simple flags or basic window attributes that can be easily bypassed. Modern screenshot tools, browser extensions, and built-in Windows features (Win+Shift+S) pose significant threats to sensitive data visualization.

### Previous Limitations
- Basic screenshot flags easily bypassed
- No protection against modern snipping tools  
- Limited coverage of capture methods
- No real-time detection capabilities
- Single-layer protection insufficient

## 🚀 Solution Architecture

The Enhanced Screenshot Protection System implements a comprehensive multi-layer defense strategy:

### 1. Real-time Keyboard Hook Interception
- **Low-level Windows API integration** using `SetWindowsHookEx`
- **System-level monitoring** of keyboard events before they reach applications
- **Immediate blocking** of screenshot hotkeys (Print Screen, Win+Shift+S, Alt+Print Screen)
- **High-priority thread execution** for minimal latency
- **Robust error handling** with graceful fallbacks

### 2. Advanced Clipboard Monitoring
- **50ms polling frequency** for rapid detection
- **Image format detection** in clipboard data
- **Automatic clearing** of screenshot images
- **MIME type analysis** for comprehensive coverage
- **Real-time notification** of capture attempts

### 3. Process Detection and Termination
- **Comprehensive application database** of screenshot tools
- **Real-time process enumeration** and monitoring
- **Automatic termination** of suspicious applications
- **Whitelist support** for development environments
- **Smart detection** of renamed or obfuscated tools

### 4. Statistical Behavior Analysis
- **Suspicious activity scoring** system
- **Pattern recognition** for coordinated attacks
- **Automatic breach response** with configurable thresholds
- **Event correlation** across multiple detection methods
- **Adaptive security** based on threat levels

### 5. Focus and Window Management
- **Alt+Tab blocking** to prevent task switching
- **Window focus monitoring** for suspicious behavior
- **Automatic content blurring** on focus loss
- **Dynamic security overlays** for visual protection
- **Session state management** for consistent protection

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### AdvancedScreenProtectionManager
```python
class AdvancedScreenProtectionManager:
    """Comprehensive screen protection system combining multiple defense layers"""
    
    def __init__(self, username: str, protected_widget: QWidget, 
                 log_directory: str, security_level: SecurityLevel):
        # Initialize all protection components
        self.keyboard_hook = KeyboardHook()
        self.clipboard_monitor = ClipboardMonitor()  
        self.process_monitor = ProcessMonitor()
        self.focus_monitor = WindowFocusMonitor(protected_widget)
        
    def start_protection(self):
        """Start all protection layers simultaneously"""
        # Activate keyboard hooks, clipboard monitoring, process detection
        # Begin statistical analysis and event logging
```

#### Windows Keyboard Hook System
```python
class KeyboardHook(QObject):
    """Windows-specific keyboard hook for screenshot hotkey interception"""
    
    def _keyboard_proc(self, n_code, w_param, l_param):
        """Low-level keyboard hook callback"""
        # Intercept Print Screen, Win+Shift+S, Alt+Print Screen
        # Apply suppression windows for ultra-fast key combinations
        # Emit security alerts for detected attempts
        return 1  # Block the key event
```

#### Statistical Analysis Engine
```python
def _on_screenshot_hotkey_detected(self):
    """Handle screenshot hotkey detection with statistical analysis"""
    self.suspicious_activity_score += 10  # High penalty
    
    if self.suspicious_activity_score >= self.max_suspicious_score:
        self._handle_critical_security_breach("Screenshot hotkey detected")
```
