## 🔐 Cryptographic Improvements

### 1. PBKDF2 Key Derivation Enhancement

**Before v2.0.0:**
- PBKDF2 iterations: 100,000 (encryption.py)
- PBKDF2 iterations: 500,000 (device_auth.py)
- Inconsistent iteration counts across modules

**After v2.0.0:**
- **Encryption Module**: 300,000 iterations (3x increase)
- **Device Authentication**: 600,000 iterations (1.2x increase)
- **Verification Hashing**: 300,000 iterations per round (1.5x increase)
- **Consistent high-security standards** across all modules

**Security Impact:**
- Significantly increased resistance to brute-force attacks
- Better protection against rainbow table attacks
- Computational cost increased to ~0.15 seconds per key derivation

### 2. AES-GCM with Associated Authenticated Data (AAD)

**Enhancement Details:**
- **Added AAD binding** to prevent ciphertext manipulation
- **Context binding**: `AAD = "BAR|v2|" + salt`
- **Authentic encryption** with tamper detection
- **Oracle attack prevention** through generic error handling

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Before: Basic AES-GCM
ciphertext = aesgcm.encrypt(nonce, data, None)

# After: AES-GCM with AAD
aad = b"BAR|v2|" + salt
ciphertext = aesgcm.encrypt(nonce, data, aad)
```

**Security Benefits:**
- Prevents ciphertext substitution attacks
- Binds encrypted data to application context
- Detects tampering attempts immediately
- Eliminates padding oracle vulnerabilities

### 3. Constant-Time Secure Comparison

**Implementation:**
- Replaced string comparisons with `secrets.compare_digest()`
- **Timing attack resistance** for all security-critical comparisons
- **Hardware fingerprint verification** now timing-safe
- **Password hash verification** protected against timing analysis

**Affected Operations:**
- Hardware ID verification
- Password hash comparison
- Cryptographic key validation
- Authentication token verification

### 4. Secure Memory Management Enhancement

**Improvements:**
- **Multi-pass memory overwriting** (zeros → ones → random → zeros)
- **Automatic memory locking** where supported by OS
- **Secure string handling** with context managers
- **Immediate cleanup** of sensitive data after use

**Memory Clearing Process:**
```python
# Multiple-pass secure overwrite
for i in range(key_len):
    self._master_key[i] = 0        # Pass 1: Zeros
for i in range(key_len):
    self._master_key[i] = 255      # Pass 2: Ones  
# Pass 3: Random data
# Pass 4: Final zeros
```

### 5. Enhanced Input Validation

**New Validation Features:**
- **Type checking** for all encryption parameters
- **Size limits** (1GB maximum file size)
- **Empty data detection** with appropriate errors
- **Base64 validation** for encrypted content
- **Nonce/salt size verification**

**Prevented Attack Vectors:**
- Buffer overflow attempts
- Type confusion attacks
- Memory exhaustion attacks
- Invalid encoding exploitation

### 2. Master Key Security

**Key Management:**

### 3. Password Strength Enforcement

**Requirements (Unchanged but Validated):**
- Minimum 12 characters length
