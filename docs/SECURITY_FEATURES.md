## 🛡️ Welcome to BAR Security

This guide covers all the security features built into BAR (Burn After Reading) to keep your sensitive data safe. I've designed everything to be powerful yet easy to use.

---

## 🔐 Core Security Features

### 1. Device Authentication

**What it does**: Locks BAR to your specific device using hardware fingerprinting.

**How it works**:
- First time setup: Create a master password
- Your device is bound to this password
- Can't be transferred to another device
- No password recovery (by design - maximum security)

**Usage**:
- First run: Setup your master password
- Every session: Unlock with your password
- Lock anytime: Menu → Device → Lock Device

---

### 2. Screenshot Protection

**What it does**: Prevents anyone from capturing your screen when viewing sensitive files.

**Protection includes**:
- 🚫 Blocks Print Screen key
- 🚫 Blocks Windows Snipping Tool (Win+Shift+S)
- 🚫 Detects and closes screenshot apps
- 🚫 Monitors clipboard for screenshots
- 💧 Adds moving watermarks to deter capture
- 👁️ Blurs content when window loses focus

**Security Levels**:
- **Development**: Relaxed (for testing)
- **Basic**: Standard protection
- **High**: Aggressive blocking
- **Maximum**: All features enabled

---

### 3. View-Only Files

**What it does**: Share files that can only be viewed, never saved or copied.

**Features**:
- ✅ Recipients can view content
- ❌ Cannot copy text
- ❌ Cannot save files
- ❌ Cannot screenshot (protected)
- 💧 Watermarks show viewer info
- 📊 Track who accessed what

---

### 4. Secure Memory System

**What it does**: Keeps sensitive data encrypted in memory, even while you're using it.

**Protection includes**:
- 🔒 Military-grade encryption (AES-256)
- 🧹 Secure deletion (8-pass overwrite)
- 🔐 Memory locking (prevents swap to disk)
- 🛡️ Tamper detection
- 💾 Hardware binding option

**When to use**:
- Passwords and keys
- Decrypted file contents
- Authentication tokens
- Any sensitive data in memory

---

### 5. Emergency Wipe System

**What it does**: Quickly destroy all BAR data if needed.

**Three levels**:

#### Selective Wipe (5 seconds)
- Clears active sessions
- Removes temporary files
- App keeps running

#### Aggressive Wipe (30-90 seconds)
- Deletes ALL BAR data
- Removes all files
- App exits completely
- Secure 7-pass deletion

#### Scorched Earth (10-30 minutes)
- Everything from Aggressive
- Cleans Windows Registry
- Unlimited free space scrubbing
- Anti-forensic measures
- Forces system restart

**⚠️ Warning**: Data destruction is permanent and irreversible!

---

### 6. Authentication System

**What it does**: Simple, secure single-user authentication.

**How it works**:
- One master password per device
- Hardware-bound (can't be moved)
- No multi-user accounts
- No password recovery
- Auto-lock on timeout

**Flow**:
1. First time: Device Setup
2. Every use: Device Unlock
3. Main app opens directly
4. No confusing login screens

---

### 7. File Encryption

**What it does**: Encrypts your files with industry-standard security.

**Features**:
- 🔐 AES-256-GCM encryption
- 🔑 PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000+ iterations)
- 📁 Per-file encryption keys
- 🎯 Metadata protection
- 🚀 Fast encryption/decryption

---

### 8. Secure File Operations

**What it does**: Safely handles file creation, reading, and deletion.

**Deletion methods**:
- **3-pass**: Basic secure deletion
- **7-pass**: DoD standard (recommended)
- **35-pass**: Gutmann method (maximum security)

**Features**:
- Filename randomization before deletion
- NTFS alternate data stream cleanup
- Post-deletion verification
- File blacklisting
- Quarantine system
