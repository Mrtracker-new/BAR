## 📖 What's This About?

## ✨ Cool Features

### Smart File Detection

BAR automatically figures out what kind of file you're opening:

1. **Magic Bytes** (90% confident) - Reads the file signature
2. **File Extension** (70% confident) - Checks the .ext
3. **MIME Type** (50% confident) - Uses system detection

You don't have to do anything - it just works!

### Format-Specific Actions

The viewer changes based on what you're looking at:

- **Images**: Shows "View Image" button
- **Audio**: Shows "Play Audio" button  
- **Video**: Shows "Play Video" button
- **Text**: Shows readable content with stats
- **Documents**: Smart "Open Externally" option

### Tabbed Interface

Two handy tabs:

- **Viewer**: See your file content
- **Details**: File info and metadata

### Smart Status Bar

Shows you useful info:
- File type (e.g., "JPEG Image")
- Detection confidence (High/Medium/Low)
- File stats (size, lines, etc.)

## 🔒 Security Built-In

### View-Only Protection

When a file is marked view-only:

- ❌ **Can't export it**
- ❌ **Can't open externally** (for most types)
- ✅ **Can view safely in the app**
- 💧 **Watermarks show viewer info**

### Secure External Viewing

When you open files externally:

1. Creates a secure temporary file
2. Opens in your default app
3. Cleans up automatically when done
4. Works in a separate thread (doesn't freeze BAR)

### Watermarks for Protection

For view-only files:
- **Images**: Visible watermark overlay
- **Text**: Watermark text embedded
- Shows your username and timestamp
- Can't be easily removed

## 💡 Smart Messages

BAR gives you helpful messages based on what you're viewing:

### Examples

**For Images:**
> "This JPEG image can be displayed directly in the application."

**For Audio:**
> "This MP3 audio file can be played using your default audio player."

**For View-Only PDFs:**
> "This PDF is view-only and cannot be exported. External viewing is not available."

**For Archives:**
> "This ZIP archive contains compressed data and cannot be viewed directly. Export it to extract the contents."

## 🚀 Adding Files

When you add a file to BAR:

1. **Automatic Detection** - BAR figures out the file type
